## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
